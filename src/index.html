  <meta name="description" content="The University GPA Calculator Project is a web-based application developed by our team to
  assist students in calculating their Grade Point Average (GPA) at the university level. The tool simplifies the often
  complex and time-consuming process of manually computing GPA and provides students with a user-friendly interface to
  obtain accurate and instant results. This project was initiated in response to the growing need for an efficient GPA
  calculator to streamline academic planning and decision-making.">
